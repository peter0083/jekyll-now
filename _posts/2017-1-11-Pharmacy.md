  In early 2015, patient RB, a pleasant 70-year-old gentleman, came to my pharmacy to fill his new prescription on Amlodipine, an antihypertensive drug, to have his dose increased to a higher dose (10mg once daily for 3 months).  Mr. RB reported that he had been stabilized at a low dose 2.5mg and his blood pressure is well controlled. He showed me his blood pressure diary that most readings are around 118/80 mmHg. These readings were recorded at each follow-up appointment at family doctorâ€™s office since 2012. However, his family physician Dr. BE was surprised to see that his blood pressure was high (135/77mmHg) in the most recent appointment so Dr. BE wrote a new order with new dose 10mg.  In addition to antihypertensive medications, Mr. RB was also on diabetes medication Metformin 500mg twice daily while his diabetes markers were on target.  Dr. BE scheduled RB to come back for a re-evaluation of his new 10mg dose after 3 months.  With this information in mind, I realized increasing Amlodipine from 2.5mg to 10mg was not the best option.
    
    
  According to therapeutic reference (1), dose titration of antihypertensive should be gradual and follow-up appointments should be scheduled within 4 to 8 weeks of a dose change.  Having Mr. RB on one high-dose antihypertensive would increase the likelihood of unwanted side effects such as edema and dizziness. (1) The recommendation for Mr. RB was to add a second antihypertensive drug, Ramipril 5mg once daily, in addition to his existing Amlodipine 2.5mg once daily regimen.  Ramipril not only can lower blood pressure but also has a kidney protective effect. (1) Ramipril-amlodipine-low-dose combination has a synergistic antihypertensive property that is superior to amlodipine-alone-high-dose therapy. (1) Dr. BE accepted my recommendation and Mr. RB started the combination therapy. Three months later, Mr. RB came back for a Ramipril refill and told me that he was glad Ramipril worked well. His blood pressure was back to 115/80 mmHg. 
    
    
  Another possible approach may be prescription adapation. Dr. BE had specifically asked me not to adapt his prescriptions verbally. Even though he did not write "do not adapt/renewal" on the prescription I still honour his request. Patients are encouraged to talk to their pharmacists about any changes in their drug therapy.
