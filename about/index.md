I am a pharmacist and a data science professional working towards a Master of Data Science degree at The University of British Columbia. Years of experience in primary care setting exposed me to the challenges of digital health.  My goal is to solve healthcare and drug-therapy problems with various data science techniques. Ultimately, improve patients' quality of life.

I am also a member of GBM Taiko (Japanese Drumming) and [Ten Drum Canada](https://www.facebook.com/TenDrumCanada/?fref=ts) (Contemporary Taiwanese Percussion)
